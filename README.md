# mini-sqldb-rs 🦀📚

**mini-sqldb-rs** This is a personal learning project where I'm diving into the world of SQL databases by building one from scratch using Rust. The primary goal here is to solidify my understanding of Rust while exploring the inner workings of a database system. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

*(Yes, the real goal is to write more Rust ... and cry about lifetimes 😭)*


## Project Status 🚧

This is very much a work in progress! I'm just starting out 🌱️, so there's not much code to see yet. As I progress through the course, I'll be adding more functionality and refining the implementation.
